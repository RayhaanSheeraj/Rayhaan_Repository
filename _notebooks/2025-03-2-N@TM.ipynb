    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Color Palette**  \n",
    "  - Adding more color variety could enhance the visual appeal instead of relying solely on gray.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **User-Friendly Navigation**  \n",

    "  - Special privileges for admins improve management and oversight.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Areas for Improvement:\n",
    "- **Refining Admin Permissions**  \n",
    "  - Some admin privileges, like viewing user packing checklists, seem unnecessary.  \n",
    "  - Consider limiting access to maintain user privacy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Design Consistency**  \n",
    "  - The main page’s purple background doesn’t match the rest of the design.  \n",
    "  - Adjusting it to align with the dark gray and neon blue theme would improve cohesion.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fixing Broken Links**  \n",
    "  - Some buttons lead to 404 pages.  \n",
    "  - Unused links should be removed or updated to avoid confusion.  \n",
