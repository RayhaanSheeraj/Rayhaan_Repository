    "Modern operating systems and web browsers have ways to stop programs or scripts that run for too long or never stop. On computers, tools like Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (Mac) help users see which programs are using too much memory or CPU, and they can force them to stop. Sometimes the system will do this on its own if the program is using too many resources. In web browsers, if a script keeps running too long, the browser might show a message like \"Page Unresponsive\" and let the user choose to stop or wait. Some browsers run scripts in the background so the whole page doesn’t crash and freeze. If a page crashes, some websites can reload themselves. Developers also use error messages and logs to help fix these problems. These tools help keep your computer and browser running smoothly, even when something goes wrong.\n",

    "Social Network Analysis uses graphs to study how people or things are connected. In social media, users are represented as nodes, and their relationships, like following or messaging each other, are shown as edges. By looking at these connections, we can understand how information spreads or how communities form. A real-world example is Facebook, where users are nodes, and friendships or interactions are edges. Graph theory helps Facebook recommend friends, suggest groups, or even detect fake accounts by analyzing patterns in how users are connected.\n",
