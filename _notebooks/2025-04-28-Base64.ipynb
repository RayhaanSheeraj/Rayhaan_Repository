    "\n",
    "Base64 turns files (like images) into long strings of letters and numbers.  \n",
    "Instead of linking to an image file, you can just paste the Base64 string into your code.  \n",
    "It’s useful when you want to keep everything in one file or don’t want to rely on outside files.\n",

    "- You’re sending the image in something like an email or a notebook\n",
    "- You want the image to always show up, even if the original file is missing\n",
