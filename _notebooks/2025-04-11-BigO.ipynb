    "|-----------|----------------|-------------|\n",
    "| O(1)      | Constant Time  | Execution time is the same regardless of input size. |\n",
    "| O(log n)  | Logarithmic Time | Execution time increases logarithmically with input size. |\n",
    "| O(n)      | Linear Time    | Execution time grows proportionally to input size. |\n",
    "| O(n log n)| Linearithmic Time | Common in efficient sorting algorithms like Merge Sort and Quick Sort. |\n",

    "| O(2ⁿ)     | Exponential Time | Execution time doubles with each additional element. |\n",
