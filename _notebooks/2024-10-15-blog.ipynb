    "        <p>The lessons I taught were 3.3 and 3.5. In these lessons the topics covered were included algorithms, mathematical expressions, relational operators, and logical operators in both JavaScript and Python. An algorithm is a step by step procedure to execute a certain task. A real life example of an algorithm is following a recipe. Mathematical expression can be used in code to perform calculations and change variables. Relational and logical operators paired with if/else statements are used to control the flow of your code to give a certain outcome. Relational operators compare 2 different expressions together and give a boolean value of either True or False. On the other hand, logical operators combine multiple values or expressions and return either a true or false. Some common logical operators include and, or, not. These concepts are very to coding as they allow coders to create efficient, logical, and functional programs.</p>\n",

    "        In this unit I learned about variables, strings, lists, Booleans, conditionals, nested conditionals, math operators, relational operators, logical operators and iterations in both Python and JavaScript. In this unit, I learned that variables are used to store different types of data, like numbers and text. I also learned that you can use lists to have a collection of multiple items. I know how to use Booleans for true or false values and how to use conditionals to manage the outcome of programs. Additionally, I know that you can use iterations to repeat actions through loops. Using this new knowledge, I plan to implement these concepts into my code to create effective and efficient programs.\n",

    "    Throughout this unit, I had many struggles and many accomplishments. One thing I struggled with is iterations and how they work in loops. To overcome this challenge, I used the popcorn hacks to practice and understand what was happening in the code. When I finally would understand how to use iterations, I completed the popcorn hacks and I would write comments to make sure I understood the code. I think this unit was very helpful as I got to both teach a lesson and learn other lessons to give me a greater understanding of the overall unit on how to use code efficiently. \n",
