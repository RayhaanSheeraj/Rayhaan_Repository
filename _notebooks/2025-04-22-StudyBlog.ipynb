    "- **Graphs** model relationships using **nodes (vertices)** and **edges (connections)**; used in pathfinding (Google Maps), web ranking (PageRank), and network routing.\n",
    "- **Complete Graph**: Every pair of nodes is directly connected.\n",
    "- **Adjacency Matrix** (2D array of 0s/1s) vs. **Adjacency List** (each node stores a list of neighbors).\n",
    "- **Heuristics** are smart shortcuts for solving complex problems when exact solutions are too expensive.\n",
    "- Examples of heuristics: **Nearest Neighbor** (TSP), **Greedy Algorithms** (Coin Change), and **Heuristic Search** (using distances like Manhattan or Euclidean).\n",
