    "- I mastered a majority of the skills in the 2020 MC Practice Test. \n",
    "### Skills I can Imporve on\n",
    "- However one skill I missed out on was skill 4.C: Identify and correct errors in algorithms and programs, including error discovery through testing. This skill fallls under the topic 1.4 Identifying and Correcting Errors\n",
    "    - I can improve on this skill by continuing to code and help others fixing bugs in code. \n",
    "### Skills that weren't present in the test: \n",
    "- Skill 3.A: Generalize data sources through variables. \n",
    "- Skill 4.A: Explain how a code segment or program functions. \n",
    "- Skill 6.A: Collaborate in the development of solutions. \n",
    "- Skill 6.B: Use safe and secure methods when using computing devices. \n",
    "- Skill 6.C: Acknowledge the intellectual property of others.\n",
    "    - I can improve these skills by practicing other MCs\n",

    "## What did I learn from this quiz?\n",
    "- 5.6: Safe Computing\n",
    "    - Learning how to protect personal and sensitive information from threats and vulnerabilities.\n",
    "- 3.17: Algorithmic Efficiency\n",
    "    - Studying how to measure and improve the efficiency of algorithms.\n",
    "- 4.2: Fault Tolerance\n",
    "    - Learning about techniques and strategies to build fault-tolerant systems, such as redundancy and error detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "## Questions I got wrong:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q16 Error in wordList traversal\n",

    "\n",
    "- The option I chose was C. Placing the code between lines 6 and 7 only decreases \"index\" when \"the\" or \"a\" is found. Instead, \"index\" should decrease after checking every element.\n",
    "- Option D was the correct answer because The program goes through wordList from the end to the start, removing any elements that are \"the\" or \"a.\" Placing the statement between lines 7 and 8 decreases index after checking each element, making sure all elements are checked.\n",
