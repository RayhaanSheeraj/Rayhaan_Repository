    "Negative effects of technology such as privacy breache can harm individuals and society and can make people feel unsafe. Responsible programming could involve implememnting security measures that respect user privacy, to stop the misuese of technology. If we can prioritize user safety we can create safer enviroment. \n",

    "- **AI Innovation:** Language translation AI  \n",
    "- **Original Use:** Made to translate text or speech between languages.  \n",
    "- **New Use Case:** Used to translate animal sounds into human language.  \n",
    "- **Impact:**  \n",
    "  - **Benefits:**  \n",
    "    - Helps researchers understand animal communication. \n",
    "    - Helps us learn a lot more about animals. \n",
    "    - Could improve animal care and conservation. \n",
    "  - **Risks:**  \n",
    "    - Could be misused for entertainment, not science. \n",
    "    - AI is not fully advanced yet, so translations could be wrong leading to misunderstandings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hack 2\n",
    "- **Problem:** Fake videos made by AI (deepfakes).  \n",
    "- **Risk:** Can spread lies, ruin reputations, and can cause harm.  \n",
    "- **Solution 1:** Add watermarks or digitial fingerprints to real videos to prove they are real.  \n",
    "- **Solution 2:** Use AI to spot and label fake videos before they spread.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reflection:**  \n",
    "AI is powerful but can be dangerous if misused. Making it safe helps protect people from false information. I beleive that is is very important to have an AI that is honest and fair.  \n",

    "\n",
    "- **AI Example:** Amazonâ€™s hiring AI  \n",
    "- **What Happened:** It was made to pick the best job candidates, but it unfairly favored men over women. The AI was trained on past data, which mostly had male applicants, making it biased.  \n",
    "- **Response:** Amazon stopped using the AI for hiring because of the unfairness.  \n",
    "- **Prevention:** Developers should have tested the AI with more balanced data before using it for real hiring.  \n",
