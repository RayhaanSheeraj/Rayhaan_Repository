At first when I opened the Tools Setup Page, I was confused as there were so much information at the same time but as time progressed, I slowly started to understand and figured how to set up VS Code. 

Through my proccess I learnt that terminal was very important to help setup wsl. WSL allows Linux programs to run directly on Windows and that 
Ubuntu is a Linux operating system known for its ease of use, security, and extensive community support. 

Through reasearch and help from other peers I learned that Linux cd command helps you navigate and move around the directory structure of the filesystem. After setting up VS Code, I was finally able to connect my github to VS Code and create my own repository. 

I had to clone the nighthawk pages repository but eventually I hope to modify my repository to have differnt content and look very differnt to what it started like.

## Version Control
Version control helps me keep track of file changes and collaborate with others efficiently. I used it to clone GitHub repositories to my local machine by running the git clone command, which gives me a full copy of the project.

Once the files are on my computer, I can navigate through them using terminal commands like cd to change directories. 

When I make changes to the project, I stage them with git add, commit them using git commit -m, and push them back to GitHub using git push. 

This process ensures my changes are saved both locally and on the remote repository. If I need to, I can view all the files and their history directly on GitHub by exploring the repository’s structure.

## Localhost vs. Deployed Server
When I view my project on localhost, it's running on my own machine with a URL like http://127.0.0.1:4100/Rayhaan_Repository/, which means only I can see it.This local version is not accessible to anyone else unless they’re on my network. 

 Meanwhile, when I deploy my project to GitHub Pages, it becomes accessible online with a URL like https://rayhaansheeraj.github.io/Rayhaan_Repository/. This deployed version allows anyone with the link to view my project. 
 
 Using localhost is great for testing and bug fixing, while GitHub Pages lets me share my work with others.

## DNS and Github Pages
 My GitHub Pages project has a domain associated with it. The URL for my GitHub Pages is different from other people URLs because each GitHub Pages site is unique to the specific repository or custom domain set by the user.I didn't change the default URL provided by GitHub Pages, which uses my GitHub username and the repository name.
