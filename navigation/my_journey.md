At first when I opened the Tools Setup Page, I was confused as there were so much information at the same time but as time progressed, I slowly started to understand and figured how to set up VS Code. 

Through my proccess I learnt that terminal was very important to help setup wsl. WSL allows Linux programs to run directly on Windows and that 
Ubuntu is a Linux operating system known for its ease of use, security, and extensive community support. 

Through reasearch and help from other peers I learned that Linux cd command helps you navigate and move around the directory structure of the filesystem. After setting up VS Code, I was finally able to connect my github to VS Code and create my own repository. 

I had to clone the nighthawk pages repository but eventually I hope to modify my repository to have differnt content and look very differnt to what it started like.

      box-shadow: 25px 25px 25px rgba(75, 0, 150, 10); 
      display: inline-block;
       }
